<b>VERSION MANAGEMENT</b>
<p><b>WesMC Utils Bundle</b> delivers a Hubitat library and a demonstration file.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hubitat tracks the relationship between instantiated <b>Apps</b> &
    <b>Devices</b> and their footing in <b>Apps Code</b>, <b>Drivers Code</b> and
    <b>Libraries Code</b>.</li>
  <li>Hubitat Bundles can include <b>Apps Code</b>, <b>Drivers Code</b> and/or
    <b>Libraries Code</b>.</li>
  <li>Hubitat <b>DOES NOT</b> provide version control of <b>Apps Code</b>,
    <b>Drivers Code</b> or <b>Libraries Code</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The only way for two versions of code (App, Driver or Library) to coexist
    is to include version information in the filename (i.e., of the App, Driver
    and Library).</li>
</ul>
<b>Extra Stuff (Needs Work)</b>
  <li>The <b>library's</b> filename will change.<br/>
    <em>[ Example: libWesMCUtils-<b>V1</b>.groovy â†’ libWesMCUtils-<b>V2</b>.groovy ]</em>
  </li>

= Hubitat Version Management Challenges

* Hubitat tracks the relationship between instantiated *Apps & Devices* and their association with *Apps Code*, *Drivers Code* and *Libraries Code*.

* *Hubitat Bundles* can include *Apps Code*, *Drivers Code* and *Libraries Code*.

* Hubitat *DOES NOT* provide version control of *Apps Code*, *Drivers Code* or *Libraries Code*.

* The only way for multiple versions of code (App, Driver or Library) to coexist is to create a distinct file (filename) per version.
